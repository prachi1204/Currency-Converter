This application is using http://fixer.io/ to get the conversion rates. 
Free subscription has limited access and so it is not accepting the 2 currency codes to get the rate. Instead, it is providing all currency rate  with base as EUR.

EUR as base is hard coded for select current currency. 

Code is written in a way that it can handle the passed parameters dynamically if we have the complete access of fixer.
